Cheese Touch: Create a non-fungible token dapp for a token that no one wants to have, a cheese touch token.
* Allow only 1 token to be ‘live’ at a time; if there is no live token anyone can create one.
* Allow users to transfer the live token to anyone else.
* If any user holds a live token for more than 24 hours then they can no longer transfer it, and the token should no longer be live.
